##<a name="section1"></a>Functionality
`com.iot.telefonica.cygnus.sinks.OrionHDFSSink`, or simply `OrionHDFSSink` is a sink designed to persist NGSI-like context data events within a [HDFS](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsUserGuide.html) deployment. Usually, such a context data is notified by a [Orion Context Broker](https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-orion) instance, but could be any other system speaking the <i>NGSI language</i>.

Independently of the data generator, NGSI context data is always [transformed](from_ngsi_events_to_flume_events.md) into internal Flume events at Cygnus sources thanks to `com.iot.telefonica.cygnus.handlers.OrionRestHandler`. In the end, the information within these Flume events must be mapped into specific HDFS data structures.

###<a name="section1.1"></a>Mapping Flume events to HDFS data structures
[HDFS organizes](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsDesign.html#The_File_System_Namespace) the data in folders containinig big data files. Such organization is exploited by `OrionHDFSSink` each time a Flume event is taken, by performing the following workflow:

1. The bytes within the event's body are parsed and a `NotifyContextRequest` object container is created.
2. According to the [naming conventions](naming_convetions.md), a folder called `/user/<hdfs_userame>/<fiware-service>/<fiware-servicePath>/<destination>` is created (if not existing yet), where `<hdfs_username>` is a configuration parameter, and `<fiware_service>`, `<fiware-servicePath>` and `<destination>` values are got from the event headers.
3. The context responses/entities within the container are iterated, and a file called `<destination>.txt` is created (if not yet existing), where `<destination>` value is got from the event headers.
4. The context attributes within each context response/entity are iterated, and a new Json line (or lines) is appended to the current file. The format for this append depends on the configured persistence mode:
    * `row`: A Json line is added for each notified context attribute. This kind of line will always contain 8 fields:
        * `recvTimeTs`: UTC timestamp expressed in miliseconds.
        * `recvTime`: UTC timestamp in human-redable format ([ISO 6801](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)).
        * `entityId`: Notified entity identifier.
        * `entityType`: Notified entity type.
        * `attrName`: Notified attribute name.
        * `attrType`: Notified attribute type.
        * `attrValue`: In its simplest form, this value is just a string, but since Orion 0.11.0 it can be Json object or Json array.
        * `attrMd`: It contains a string serialization of the metadata array for the attribute in Json (if the attribute hasn't metadata, an empty array `[]` is inserted).
    * `column`: A single Json line is added for all the notified context attributes. This kind of line will contain two fields per each entity's attribute (one for the value, called `<attrName>`, and other for the metadata, called `<attrName>_md`), plus an additional field about the reception time of the data (`recvTime`).

####Important notes regarding the persistence mode
Please observe not always the same number of attributes is notified; this depends on the subscription made to the NGSI-like sender. This is not a problem for the `row` persistence mode, since fixed 8-fields Json documents are appended for each notified attribute. Nevertheless, the `column` mode may be affected by several Json documents of different lengths (in term of fields). Thus, the `column` mode is only recommended if your subscription is designed for always sending the same attributes, event if they were not updated since the last notification.

###<a name="section1.2"></a>Hive
A special feature regarding HDFS persisted data is the posssibility to exploit it through Hive, a SQL-like querying system. `OrionHDFSSink` automatically [creates a Hive external table](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL#LanguageManualDDL-Create/Drop/TruncateTable) (similar to a SQL table) for each persisted entity in the default database, being the name for such tables as `<username>_<fiware-service>_<fiware-servicePath>_<destination>_[row|column]`.

The fields regarding each data row match the fields of the Json documents appended to the HDFS files. They are deserialized by using a [Json serde](https://github.com/rcongiu/Hive-JSON-Serde).

[Top](#top)

###<a name="section1.3"></a>Example
Assuming the following Flume event is created from a notified NGSI context data (the code below is an <i>object representation</i>, not any real data format):

    flume-event={
        headers={
	        content-type=application/json,
	        fiware-service=vehicles,
	        fiware-servicepath=4wheels,
	        timestamp=1429535775,
	        transactionId=1429535775-308-0000000000,
	        ttl=10,
	        destination=car1_car
        },
        body={
	        entityId=car1,
	        entityType=car,
	        attributes=[
	            {
	                attrName=speed,
	                attrType=float,
	                attrValue=112.9
	            },
	            {
	                attrName=oil_level,
	                attrType=float,
	                attrValue=74.6
	            }
	        ]
	    }
    }

Assuming `hdfs_username=myuser`, `service_as_namespace=false` and `attr_persistence=row` as configuration parameters, then `OrionHDFSSink` will persist the data within the body as:

    $ hadoop fs -cat /user/myuser/vehicles/4wheels/car1_car/car1_car.txt
    {"recvTimeTs":"1429535775","recvTime":"2015-04-20T12:13:22.41.124Z","entityId":"car1","entityType":"car","attrName":"speed","attrType":"float","attrValue":"112.9","attrMd":[]}
    {"recvTimeTs":"1429535775","recvTime":"2015-04-20T12:13:22.41.124Z","entityId":"car1","entityType":"car","attrName":"oil_level","attrType":"float","attrValue":"74.6","attrMd":[]}

If `attr_persistence=colum` then `OrionHDFSSink` will persist the data within the body as:

    $ hadoop fs -cat /user/myser/vehicles/4wheels/car1_car/car1_car.txt
    {"recvTime":"2015-04-20T12:13:22.41.124Z","speed":"112.9","speed_md":[],"oil_level":"74.6","oil_level_md":[]}

NOTE: `hadoop fs -cat` is the HDFS equivalent to the Unix command `cat`.

With respect to Hive, the content of the tables in the `row` and `column` modes, respectively, is:

    $ hive
    Logging initialized using configuration in jar:file:/usr/local/hive-0.9.0-shark-0.8.0-bin/lib/hive-common-0.9.0-shark-0.8.0.jar!/hive-log4j.properties
    Hive history file=/tmp/root/hive_job_log_root_201504201213_821987796.txt
    hive> select * from myuser_vehicles_4wheels_car1_car_row;
    OK
    1429535775	2015-04-20T12:13:22.41.124Z	car1	car	speed		float	112.9	[]
    1429535775	2015-04-20T12:13:22.41.124Z	car1	car	oil_level	float	74.6	[]
    hive> select * from myuser_vehicles_4wheels_car1_car_column;
    2015-04-20T12:13:22.41.124Z		112.9	[]	74.6	[]

NOTE: `hive` is the Hive CLI for locally querying the data.

##<a name="section4"></a>Implementation details
###<a name="section4.1"></a>`OrionHDFSSink` class
As any other NGSI-like sink, `OrionHDFSSink` extends the base `OrionSink`. The methods that are extended are:

    void persist(Map<String, String>, NotifyContextRequest) throws Exception;
    
The context data, already parsed by `OrionSink` in `NotifyContextRequest`, is iterated and persisted in the HDFS backend by means of a `HDFSBackendImpl` instance. Header information from the `Map<String, String>` is used to complete the persitence process, such as the timestamp or the destination.
    
    public void start();

`HDFSBackendImpl` is created. This must be done at the `start()` method and not in the constructor since the invoking sequence is `OrionHDFSSink()` (contructor), `configure()` and `start()`.

    public void configure(Context);
    
A complete configuration as the described above is read from the given `Context` instance.

[Top](#top)

###<a name="section4.2"></a>`HDFSBackendImpl` class
This is a convenience backend class for HDFS that extends the `HttpBackend` abstract class (provides common logic for any Http connection-based backend) and implements the `HDFSBackend` interface (provides the methods that any HDFS backend must implement). Relevant methods are:

    public void createDir(String dirPath) throws Exception;
    
Creates a HDFS directory, given its path.
    
    public void createFile(String filePath, String data) throws Exception;
    
Creates a HDFS file, given its path, and writes initial data to it.
    
    public void append(String filePath, String data) throws Exception;
    
Appends new data to an already existent given HDFS file.

    public boolean exists(String filePath) throws Exception;
    
Checks if a HDFS file, given its path, exists ot not.
    
    public void provisionHiveTable(String dirPath) throws Exception;
    
Provisions a Hive table with data stored in row-like mode within the given HDFS path. No fields list is needed since this storing mode has a constant format.
    
    public void provisionHiveTable(String dirPath, String fields) throws Exception;
    
Provisions a Hive table with data stores in column-like mode within the given HDFS path. The fields list is passed as comma-separated values since this storing mode has not a constant format.
