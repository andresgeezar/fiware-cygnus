Feature: Stored in ckan new notifications per row from context broker
  As a cygnus user
  I want to be able to store in ckan new notifications per row from context broker
  so that they become more functional and useful

  @happy_path
  Scenario Outline: stored new notifications in ckan from context broker with or without metadata
    Given copy properties.json file from "filab_properties.json" to test "ckan-sink" and sudo local "false"
    And configuration of cygnus instances, agents files quantity "1", id "test" and in "row" mode
    And copy another configuration files and restart cygnus service and this execution is only once "true"
    And verify if cygnus is installed correctly
    And "ckan" is installed correctly
    And a tenant "tenant_3", service path "/servpath01", resource "room_room2", with attribute number "4", attribute name "random" and attribute type "celcius"
    When receives a notification with attributes value "random", metadata value "True" and content "<content>"
    Then I receive an "OK" http code
    And Validate that the attribute value, metadata and type are stored in ckan
  Examples:
    | content |
    | json    |
    | xml     |
